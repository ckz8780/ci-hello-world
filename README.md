This is the first Cloud 9 project created for CodeInstitute. Its purpose is to demonstrate an understanding of using the Cloud 9 editor and also a basic understanding of the technologies we are using in the course. The website displays logos for and links to information about all the technologies that we will be learning throughout the course.
